Creating the `authorized_keys` directory in CentOS depends on whether you want to do it for the root user or for another user. Here's how to proceed in both cases:

**For Root User:**

1. **Check if the directory exists:**
   Run `ls -la /root/.ssh`. If you see `authorized_keys`, you're good to go. If not, proceed to step 2.

2. **Create the directory and set permissions:**
   Run `sudo mkdir -p /root/.ssh && sudo chmod 700 /root/.ssh`. This creates the `/root/.ssh` directory and sets its permissions to 700, allowing only the root user (owner) to read, write, and execute files within.

3. **(Optional) Create the `authorized_keys` file:**
   Run `sudo touch /root/.ssh/authorized_keys && sudo chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This creates an empty `authorized_keys` file and sets its permissions to 600, allowing only the root user to read and write to it.

**For another user:**

1. **Switch to the target user:**
   Run `su - your_username`. Replace `your_username` with the actual username.

2. **Follow steps 2 and 3 from the Root User section above.** Replace `/root/.ssh` with `~/.ssh`. This will create the directory and `authorized_keys` file within the home directory of the target user.

**Remember:**

* Ensure you have generated your SSH key pair before adding the public key to the `authorized_keys` file.
* Only copy the public key (usually named `id_rsa.pub`) to the `authorized_keys` file. Never share your private key (usually named `id_rsa`).
* Consider disabling password login after setting up SSH key authentication for enhanced security.

Example for copy the public key to the `authorized_keys` file.
```sh
echo your_pub_key >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
